Keeping them separate enables the app to remain fast while still providing valuable insights."

        "Columnar storage means Amazon Redshift stores data by column instead of by row. This makes queries much faster because most analytical queries only need a few columns, not the entire row. Instead of reading all the data in a table, Redshift only reads the columns required, which reduces disk usage and speeds up performance. It also allows better data compression since each column stores similar types of data.\n",

        "The Leader Node and Compute Node architecture makes BI reports faster because the work is divided and processed at the same time. The Leader Node receives the query and creates a plan, then sends parts of the work to multiple Compute Nodes. Each compute node processes its portion of the data in parallel, and then the leader combines the results and returns the final report. Because many nodes are working at once instead of one system doing everything, reports are generated much more quickly."
